Confidence level - choosing a level from C.Is of all samples
*As the C.I increases,critical value increases,width of C.I gets wider and confidelence level increases

Drawbacks of wider interval:
Say tomo's temparature ranges from -29C to 43C, we don't know what to expect and what dress to wear as we don't know the exact temp
*Here,width inc,accuracy inc but precision decreases.

To overcome drawback:
increase sample size, wich decreases SE and the width inc and acc and preci also is high
