In a normal distri, if we take a single sample mean, the point estimate will be around the mean but we don't know where it will be.
Here,we bring in Confidence Interval which shows that the pt. estimate lies within the range of +/- standard error distance from sample mean.

C.I = n(S.E) where n represents how much S.Ds we have to cross from the mean to find our point estimate

95% C.I - Normally we take 95% C.I which states that pt. estimate will be +/- 2 SDs from mean. This covers the centre and some parts in the surrounding area in the bell curve.

99.7% CI - Its rare but can be computed which states that pt. estimate will be +/- 3 SDs from mean. This covers the centre and major parts in the surrounding area in the bell curve.

C.I Formula:

C.I = (sample mean)+/- z*(s/sqrt(n))
Conditions for C.I - same as that of CLT


Finding critical value(z) for 95% C.I
In normally distributed bell curve, 95% .CI denotes the middle portion of bell curve. The remainder portion is (1-0.95)/2 = 0.025
By looking at the table,we find the z-score for 0.025 is +/- 1.96

Critical values must be positive, so z = 1.96 for 95% C.I

In R, qnorm(0.025) = -1.96 = 1.96
